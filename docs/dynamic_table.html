Commuting stress had a significant relationship with both burnout and turnover intention","Between mothers and fathers, there were spillover and crossover effects in regard to their commute times and various facets of satisfaction.","Commute time had a significant relationship with stress, but not mood or subjective vitality. Commute mode had a significant relationship with stress after controlling for vitality, but no significant difference between commute mode and mood levels upon arrival to work.","At both level 1 (daily) and level 2 (between persons), commuting stress had a negative relationship with safety behaviors during the commute. Furthermore, work-related affective rumination can exacerbate this relationship (partial mediation supported at level 1 and full mediation at level 20.","There are gender differences in commute time, though both genders report higher turnover intention if they have long commutes. Both genders find family supportive policies less supportive and know more about these policies when they have longer commutes.","Daily work stressors made it less likely you would engage in unsafe driving after work, but negative affect increased the liklihood of unsafe driving after work.","Individuals who underestimate their commute time experienced more stress. There were no significant relationships between congestion levels and stress levels.","Authors present 6 policy aims for improving subjective wellbeing of commuters based on critical review.","In the fully adjusted model with both dependent variables added, walkers reported significantly higher life satisfaction than those who drove to work.","Both OLS and logit regression models found commute time to have a negative impact on global subjective wellbeing and feelings of happiness from the prior day.","Commute time had a significant negative relationship with job satisfaction, leisure time satisfaction, mental health, and a positive relationship with strain.","After using anchoring vignettes to reveal scale perception bias in subjective quality of life data, overall subjective quality of life (QoL)  and health satisfaction had significant differences between bike commuters and those that commuted by walking, driving, or public transit.","Commute time has a significant negative impact on job satisfaction, but loses significance when observed solely among those with above-average incomes. Commute mode only has a significant positive influence on the above-average income cohort.","Car drivers were more likely to report feeling tired, bus passengers were most likely to report irritability, and train users were most likely to report headaches.","Workers with extended commute times were more likely to quit their job or get fired after an injury at work.","Commute satisfaction has a significant positive relationship with work-family balance satisfaction. Commute time is less influential for commute satisfaction than other factors such as low predictability. Car commuters are more stressed than walkers and bikers but not public transit users.","There are mixed findings concerning commute time and subjective wellbeing depending on its measures. Ordered models are more appropriate because they do not make assumptions that scores are cardinal and results are more straightforward.","Longer commute times were related to higher intentions to quit and lower affective committtment at a 1 year follow up","Longer commute times were associated with decreases in wellbeing through work-life balance. Job autonomy moderates the relationship between commute time and well-being, as well as commute time and commitment.","Commute unpredictability was associated with increased reported levels of stress and objective increases in salivary cortisol, but there was no differences in task motivation.","Rail commuters with longer commutes experienced more stress according to self-report measures, task persistence, and salivary cortisol.  However, spousal ratings of their partner's interpersonal interactions did not have significant relationhsips with any stress-related variable.","Individuals who commuted by car for over 30 minutes reported more mental distress, as well as individuals who commuted by public transport for more than 60 minutes.","Commute mode (driving alone, carpooling, public transit) was associated with mental health (serious mental illness, depressive event, thoughts of suicide, mental illness). Driving alone has a positive relationship with serious mental illness and a negative relationship with carpooling and public transportation. Walking and biking were not found to be significantly assocaited with mental health. Therefore, more passive modes of commuting are less prevalent in poor mental health outcomes.","Nurses who take public transportation were more willing to change their job than those who took private transportation.","Four themes captured experiences commuting: factors influencing commuting, feeling associated with different type of commute modes, comparison associated between modes of transport and effect on wellbeing, and factors associated with commuting and work-life balance.","Longer commute time was not found to have a statistically significant relationship with reduced overall satisfaction with life. There are also no significant differences between commute modes and satisfaction with life. Longer commute time is significantly related to felling more sad. Affective wellbeing and commuting by bike are positively correlated.","Commute time and distance had positive relationships with stress during the commute. When individuals found their commute stressful, they reported greater cognitive, affective, and physical involvement.","Individuals who moved and perceived their commute to be worse than before were less satisfied with their job.","Longer commuting episodes have a significant relationship with feelings of both stress and fatigue. When comparing total time commuting to feelings reported during non-commuting episodes, more time in daily comuting is associated to increased feelings of sadness and fatigue specicially during child-care activities.","Commute stress (i.e., anxiety because of public transit delays, unreliability, and safety) was related to work outcomes such as tardiness, turnover intentons, and termination threats. Female participants experienced more commute stress linked to childcare concerns (i.e., getting their child late).","Long distance commuting increases sickness absenses, and this impact was not due to poor health.","Longer commute time had a significant relationship with feeling stressed, but those who derive positive utility from commuting found commuting less stressful. There was not a significant relationship between commute mode and perceived control over commuting. Higher variability in commute time is signifciantly associated with increased stress.","Commute time is significantly positively related to the number of sickness absence days. In comparison to migrant workers, commute time is more strongly associted with absenteeism for urban workers. Commute time for both migrant and urban workers is associated with lower self-rated health status, higher depression, and liklihood of obesity.","Longer commutes and a higher frequency of traffic congestion are associated with higher levels of stress, while commuters who are satisfied with their commutes are less likely to be stressed.","Full time employees had higher odds of physical activity and sleep problems when they were commuting over 5 hrs a week. Women specifically had lower odds of problem drinking when they had longer commute times.","Public transport commuters were more likely to report perceive poor sleep quality with a longer commute time, but a public transport commute less than 30 minutes was negatively associated with stress.","After propensity scores were used to better fit the data, cyclists had significantly less absenteeism than non-cyclists. When cyclists and non-cyclists both reported good or excellent health, the cyclist group were absent for fewer days. Overall, people who cycle more often and longer distances are absent on fewer days.","Reductions in traffic conditions seem to be more important in predicting commute dissatisfaction than time traveling.","Both life satisfaction and perceived time pressure were impacted by more time spent commuting, with perceived seriousness of traffic congestion as a significant indirect effect for these relationships.","There was a significant relationship between more time active commuting and increased physical wellbeing, independent of physical activity in other domains. However, no relationship was found for mental wellbeing and active commuting.","Commute environment (e.g., air quality, scenery, safety) was found to be negatively related to recovery during the commute, opposed to having a buffering effect. Predictons that recovery during one's commute would moderate the job demands and work-life conflict relationship was only supported for the second sample with a higher socioeconomic demographics. This suggests that te positive relationship between job demands and work-life conflict is stronger when commuters have poorer recovery experiences during commutes. Recovery during the commute was actually positively related to work-life conflict. Carpooling with family was a source of recovery for commuters.","An increase of commute distance had a nonlinear effect on life satisfaction, in which commuting was detrimental only after exceeding a certain threshold. Commute distance did not have an association with affective wellbeing within the past month (i.e., feeling happy, sad, worried, angry).","Study 1: Compared to commuters with higher trait self control, commuters with low trait self control are at higher risk of quitting their job due to lower job satisfaction associated with lengthier commutes. In other words, higher self control mitigates the negative impact of longer commutes. Study 2: Longer commute time had a stronger negative relationship with job satisfaction for employees with greater work-family conflict. In addition, employees with greater work-family conflict, there wan an indirect path from commute time to turnover intention through job satisfaction.","Commute time and distance were found to be protective resources for impoverished commutes, such that commute time attenuated the positive relationship between disorderly neighborhoods and psychological distress.","There is a nonlinear relationship between travel time and commute satisfaction, where commute time only decreased satisfaction up to 54 minutes. For short commute trips under 30 minutes, those who took non-motorized commute modes reported more commute satisfaction than cars. Among those with long commutes, those who are interested in excercising are less satisfied with commuting. Job duration was a positve factor for commute satisfaction for those who traveled more than 36 minutes.","For women, commute time to work from 30-60 minutes significantly predicted work-family conflict.","Commute time had a significant negative relationship with life satisfaction for both men and women, non dual earner households, and workers with varying levels of income.","Commute time increases the likelihood that low income women will be on sick leave.","Increased commute time is associated with increased turnover intentions and decreased job satisfaction.","Commuting pilots who commuted over 43.33 hours a month or had two or more legs on their route has significantly lower satisfaction with life.","Commute time had a significant relationship with commute strain and commute choice, but there is no interaction of choice and time with strain. Commute variability had the strongest relationship with commute strain.","Commute time had a significant relationship with perceived stress, this relationship was stronger for those who commuted by car compared to public transportation.","Commuting impedance was related to subjective stress and perceived control. Perceived control had a significant negative relationship with commuting stress.","Employees selected into flextime schedules when they had longer commute times and growth needs.","Commute time was only significantly related to subjective wellbeing for bike commuters","Longer commutes had significant negative relationships with health satisfaction and current health status. Although subjective health is lower for longer commutes, individuals do not call in sick more often than those with shorter commutes.","Commute stress and attitudes towards commuting were negatively correlated with life satisfaction.","Longer commutes are associatied with lower leisure time and family life satisfction, but the U-shaped relationship flattens out around 470 kn of commuting distance. Also, commute distance did not have a significant relationship with workers' affective wellbeing.","The combination of occupational stressors (e.g., role ambiguity, role overload) and commute impedance (e.g., commute distance) accounted for variability in anxiety.","Absenteeism due to both health and other reasons is postively related to commute distance but not commute mode. Commute time is positively related to absenteeism for reasons other than health. In the middle age group, active commuting was signifcantly related to job performance. Finally, people who were more satisfied with their commute were less likely to be absent from work.","Commute duration positively correlated with commuting stress. Commuting stress was also significantly associated with more somatic symptoms, increased commute displeasure, and intention to quit. There was a positive association between commuting stress and life satisfaction.","Walkers and cyclers are more likely to be satisfied with their commute trips. Mode flexibility had a U-shaped relationship with commute satisfaction, such that inflexible trips are more satisfying than medium flexible trips. Longer commutes for those who use motorized modes are less satisfying, and departing during peak hours is less satisfying for bus and car commuters.","Active travel modes were associated with higher wellbeing than car or public transport. Time spent driving and wellbeing had a negative relationship when all other travel modes were in the reference category. Compared to consistent car travel, multimodal commtutes that included switching from a car to walking were associated with improved wellbeing.","Public transit was associated with higher levels of stress, while active commuting was associated with lower levels of stress. The use of active modes of transportation was also negatively assoicated with stress, obesity, and difficulty walking.","Commute time was not significantly related to subejctive strain variables (i.e., perceived stress, exhaustion, sleep quality, and mental health). The relationship between commute time and objective health measures (i.e., waist circumference and triglycerides) was only significant in reported correlations before confounding variables were controlled for in the linear regression models.","Commute predictability decreased perceived risk of commute and decreased commute stress. Predictability also buffers the negative impact that perceived crowding and total waiting time have on commute stress.","A longer commute time was related to slightly lower mental health scores. When commuting over 6 hours a week, job control was a significant moderator such that people with low job control experienced a greater decline in mental health than those with high job control.","Longer commutes don't necessarily relate to decreased life satisfaction or poor affect but are related to negative spillover at work.","Commute time did not have significant direct relationships with most work, family, and health outcomes other than intent to quit and work-family conflict. However, commute time was indirectly related to these outcomes through commute stress.","Long distance commuting (LDC) is negatively related to subjective wellbeing (SWB); the \"positives\" of LCD are not related to SWB. Interestingly, the negative aspects of LDC impacted social cohesion, but the positives of LDC were related to bridging social networks. So, LDC can negatively impact immediate social circles (by taking workers out of the immediate network/community) but strengthen new/external networks.","People with new long commutes report decreases in physical activity despite exercising the same amount (and they gained more weight), and people with short/medium commutes reported increases in physical activity after the move. People with long commutes reported that they were unable to take advantage of local parks due to lenght of time spent commuting.","Commute time is related to decreased happiness and life satisfaction. This relationship appears stable even when mediators are added (i.e., longer commute time is usually related to decreases in wellbeing).","Longer commutes were associated with fewer work hours, less physical exercise, and less sleep.","Commuter's mood was negatively affected by commuting impedance. Commute distance and speed accounted for variation in blood pressure levels.","A newly constructed subjective impedance measure was found to have a significant relationship with mood, satisfaction, and health measures.","Subjective impedance plays a mediational role for the physical impedance and affect relationship.","Commute time and distance negatively impact experiences of commuting stress. In addition, people who shared rides were more satisfied with their commute and less bothered by traffic congestion.","Using a combination of psychological and physiological data, results indicated that longer commute time was associated with poor sleep quality, perceived stress levels, and cotisol levels.","There were no gender differences between commute mode, but women who participated in active commuting were more likely to be sedentary at work. Long commuting related to decreased General Health Questionnaire scores regardless of commute mode.","Commute time negatively related to commute satisfaction. Walking/biking had a positive effect on commute satisfaction.","Workers who commute by bike report the best health, while those who use their car or public transit report the worst health.","Active travelers rated their commute as less stressful.","Commute time was positively associated with work hours, housing quality, education, income and health but negatively associated with job satisfaction and General Health Questionnaire scores. Especially for women, commute time is negatively related to General Health Questionnaire scores, which are stable even when considering other positive factors (e.g., housing quality and income). Active commuting had a stronger relationship with General Health Questionnaire scores than passive commuting.","Job satisfaction was negatively related to commute time and moderated by pay appropriateness. Perceptions of pay appropriateness mitigated the relationship between commute time and job satisfaction.","Commute distance is positively related to being overweight and smoking behaviors, and these relationship gets stronger with age. There was not a significant relationship found between commuting distance and perceived time pressure. In addition, time pressure did not mediate a relationship between commuting and smoking behaviors","Commuting time had a significant relationship with both perceived stress and health-related quality of life.","Women who travel at least 50km to work one way have a higher risk of mortality compared to women with shorter commutes, varying by income and education. However, this association was not found to be significant for men.","Higher levels of impedance had influence on employees' blood pressures and proofreading performance. Carpooling appears to be more stressful than single driver commuting when the route is reported to have high impedance.","Commute time is negatively related to wellbeing and mediated by satisfacion with salary. There was also no association between commuting time and other vairbales such as BMI, mental distress, perceived health, and social support.","Walkers/bikers reported higher than average commute satisfaction. Car commuters had the lowest satisfaction ratings on average. Commute time was related to travel eudaimonia.","Longer commutes (by both time and distance) were related to less control and more stress.","Commuters who bike have higher commute wellbeing, and those who drive have a lot of variability in their wellbeing scores, which is explained by travel time and travel congestion (objective impedance). Similarly, commuting via transit in crowded or congested spaces was negatively related to commute wellbeing. Job and home satisfaction are relatead to commute wellbeing. Positive appraisal of the commute trip is positively related to commute wellbeing for everyone.","A multilevel analysis revealed that commutes are affected by recovery experiences. Commute time has a significant positive relationship with anxiety after returning to work at time 2.","Commuters with high and medium impedance also reported more traffic congestion, lower satisfaction with their commute, and higher blood pressure.","Commute time is related to utility (higher pay, more money to spend due to lower cost of rent, burden of simply spending more time commuting) but longer commutes are negatively related to subjective wellbeing. This suggests that there is an optimal amount of commute time per individual - where pay and income impact the relationship - where too long of a commute is overall negative. Did not find statistically significant differences between car and transit commuters in terms of subjective wellbeing.","Commute duration was negatively related to social capital, health, and job satisfaction. Direct effect of commute duration on life satisfaction was not supported. Similarly, commute duration was not directly related to emotional wellbeing, but indirectly through job satisfaction/ social capital/health.","Those with long commutes used public transit more frequently, and those with long commutes reported more health complaints than those with shorter commutes (e.g., musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal complaints). No difference between flu and allergy complaints. Those who had these commutes for longer (i.e., more than 11 years) had more complaints than those who hadn't (i.e., less than 2 years) .","Commute time had significant relationships with both perceived stress and work-family conflict.","Commute distance is related to number of absent days with no gender differences found.","Commute time was conceptualized as a boundary-spanning demand and was associated with increased stress and work-family conflict.","Commuting time had a significant relationship with commuting stress. Individuals who commuted by car reported significantly more commuting stress and negative mood than those who commuted by train.","Commuters' state driver stress was higher when they perceived more traffic congestion and time urgency.","Some individuals describe commuting to be a space that allows them to engage in valuable activities and a routine.","Lower income respondents were less likely to use their car for commuting, and had longer commutes in time and distance. For the most part, the lower income group had less commute satisfaction compared to the higher income group. Both groups report lower commute satisfaction when their trip is congested or long, and travel mode choice did not matter for the low income workers. However, travel mode choice did matter for the high income workers in terms of commute satisfaction.","Those who appraised the travel experince negatively (e.g., negative travel attitudes) wanted shorter travel times; passive travelers (e.g., car) wanted shorter travel times, and those with active commutes (e.g., biking) wanted longer commutes. Overall people wanted about 20 minutes of travel time.","Morning commute stressors were positively related to strain, and strain was negatively related to self-regulation at work. The morning commute stressor and self-regulation relationship was mediatedy by morning strain. The morning strain-self-regulation relationship was moderated by daily task significance. Family interference with work was negatively related to self-regulation.","Commuting by shuttle and bike had the strongest relationship with commute happiness, and commute duration was negatively related to commute happiness. Gender and age differences suggest that being young, female, and having a high income were related to less commute happiness. Those who already have high wellbeing have high commute wellbeing."]],"container":"<table class=\"cell-border stripe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Study Number<\/th>\n      <th>Short Citation<\/th>\n      <th>Conceptualization of \"Commuting\"<\/th>\n      <th>Operationalization of \"Commuting\"<\/th>\n      <th>Conceptualization of Criterion<\/th>\n      <th>Operationalization of Criterion<\/th>\n      <th>Other Relevant Variables in Study (e.g., Covariates)<\/th>\n      <th>Method<\/th>\n      <th>Study Design<\/th>\n      <th>Study Analytics<\/th>\n      <th>Sample Description<\/th>\n      <th>Key Findings<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
